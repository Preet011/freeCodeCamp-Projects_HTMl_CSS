    <article><p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p></article>

    <header>So what is HTML?</header>
    <article>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, 
      <code> <p>My cat is very grumpy</p> </code>

    <article>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.<p>The main parts of our element are as follows:

</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
</li>
        <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
        <li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
</li>
        <li>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
</li>
      </ul>

    <header>Anatomy of an HTML document</header>
    <article>That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the code we put into our index.html example (which we first met in the Dealing with files article):
     <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> DOCTYPE is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However, these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.
</li>
  <li>The HTML element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element. It also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of the document.
</li>
  <li> the HEAD element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.</li>
  <li> META element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later on.</li>
  <li> TITLE element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.</li>
</article>
</section>
  </section> <section class="main-section" id="Images">
    <header>Images</header>
    <article>Let's turn our attention to the <img> element again.
<p>As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the src (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.

We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In the alt attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:

</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the alt text to them.
</li>
  <li>Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately changing the path inside your src attribute to make it incorrect. </li>
  </ul>

    <header>Marking up text</header>
    <article>This section will cover some essential HTML elements you'll use for marking up the text.<p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document can too. <p>HTML contains 6 heading levels,  although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:</p><code>
<h1>My main title</h1>
</code>
<p>As explained above, p elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content:</p>
<code><p>This is a single paragraph</p></code>

</article>
  </section> <section class="main-section" id="Links">
    <header>Links</header>
    <article>A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements.<p>. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a "ul" element.</li> 
     <li>Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an "ol" element.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following paragraph fragment into a list</p>
      <code><p>At Mozilla, we're a global community of</p>
<ul>
  
  <li>thinkers</li>
  <li>builders</li>
</ul>
<p>working together…</p>
